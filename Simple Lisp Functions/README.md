simple_functions.lsp contains three simple list functions:
- seq takes an index n and returns the nth padovan number
- sums  takes an index n and returns the number of additions required to calculate  the nth padovan number (with each call to + x y z being two additions)
- anon takes an argument tree (one of: a tree, an atom, or an empty list) and returns an identical structure with all atoms in the original structure having been converted to zero.
