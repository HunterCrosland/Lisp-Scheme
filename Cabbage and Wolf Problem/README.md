This LISP program computes the solution to the famous cabbage and wolfproblem, decribed on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem):

>Once upon a time a farmer went to a market and purchased a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. 
>On his way home, the farmer came to the bank of a river and rented a boat. 
>But crossing the river by boat, the farmer could carry only himself and a single one of his purchases: the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage.

>If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage.

>The farmer's challenge was to carry himself and his purchases to the far bank of the river, leaving each purchase intact. How did he do it?

The implementation uses the verbiage of "Homer" and "Maggie" in place of farmer and cabbage, as this is the verbiage
popularized in The Simpsons. This particular logic problem was presented in "Gone Maggie Gone" (S20E13)
